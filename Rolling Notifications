CSMM Handlebars script for rolling/rotating announcements/notifications.

The script will iterate through the list of announcements, broadcasting one per execution.
It uses a Persistent Variable to keep track. When the counter hits the max number, it will reset and start over.
Use this script in the Server Automation section of CSMM. 

* Don't forget to set the maxAnn in line 2 to match the number of announcements.
* Changing the hex numbers [89d1d6] will change the colour of the the chat message
* Change <FakePlayerName> to whatever you like. You'll see something like:
    FakePlayerName: Please /vote for our server! 

{{setVar "counter" (add (getVar "counter") 1)}};
{{setVar "maxAnn" 10}};
{{setVar "Ann1" "[89d1d6] Announcement text here"}};
{{setVar "Ann2" "[89d1d6] Announcement text here"}};
{{setVar "Ann3" "[89d1d6] Announcement text here"}};
{{setVar "Ann4" "[89d1d6] Announcement text here"}};
{{setVar "Ann5" "[89d1d6] Announcement text here"}};
{{setVar "Ann6" "[89d1d6] Announcement text here"}};
{{setVar "Ann7" "[89d1d6] Announcement text here"}};
{{setVar "Ann8" "[89d1d6] Announcement text here"}};
{{setVar "Ann9" "[89d1d6] Announcement text here"}};
{{setVar "Ann10" "[89d1d6] Announcement text here"}};
{{#if (gte (getVar "counter") (getVar "maxAnn"))}}  
  {{setVar "counter" 1}} 
{{/if}};
say2 <FakePlayerName> "{{getVar (add "Ann" (getVar "counter"))}}";
