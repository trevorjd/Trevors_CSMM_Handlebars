This is a Custom Hook to provide a warning to players when a screamer/scout spawns.
When a screamer spawns, players within 300m should receive a private message alerting them of the event. 
Colour of the message can be adjusted by changing the value of [ff8a33]. It's currently a nice, semi-alarming orange.

This mod was developed for a server running the Improved Hordes server-side mod by FilUnderscore.

I think it should work without that mod but I haven't personally tested it.
