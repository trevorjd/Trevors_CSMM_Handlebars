This repo is a place for me to store the scripts I've developed for managing the oldFARKs 7 Days to Die server.
It serves me as a backup for things that work, and if it helps others solve problems, then even better!

A big thanks to Catalysm, Saminal, RDois and Prisma501 in the CSMM Discord for their extensive help and guidance.
